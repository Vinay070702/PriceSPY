0,Anand,Reviewed in India 🇮🇳 on 11 July 2022,5.0 ,"Small, not too heavy, good looking.","Hi guys! Bought this yesterday, so haven’t used it much, so an early review. But the most detailed review so please read till the end. Very important points are mentioned.Looks are cute! It looks really nice and elegant. I am using it with a MacBook Air. So far it seems there are no problems using it. The scrolling is smooth, connection does not drop, and there is no lag. Connection is instant. There is no pairing required. It's plug and play along with the dongle provided with it.It sits low on the table, feels weighty but not in a wrong way. The battery adds to it's weight, but I have used heavier mice before, and this one feels just right. It has good grip. Nothing to complain about that.Buttons are nice and clicks are satisfactory, not too noisy; they are just right. Scroll wheel doesn't feel cheap at all, though I believe it could've been better quality. Body is matt finish and doesn't leave fingerprints on it, though if you're someone who eats and handles the mouse, then it'll show the oil prints and that's true with any peripherals. The mouse doesn't feel cheap overall, but it is definitely plasticky, though not in the bad sense. It is definitely not cheap looks wise.There is an on, off switch on the bottom which is helpful in saving the battery (which is included) when the mouse is not in use. There is no light on the bottom which is good if you have kids in the house who keep flipping the mouse and staring at the super bright light. So that's a good thing and a definite plus! The overall shape and size works in the favour of the mouse, and a variety of users with small and large palms will be satisfied with it.Now over to a major flaw. The mouse connects only though it's own usb dongle (which by the way comes tucked inside the body of the mouse itself, inside the battery door, which I found mighty impressive) and not through the laptop's bluetooth. Now this means two things- 1. You have to carry around the usb dongle with you everywhere you go, which means if you happen to forget it at home while traveling and carry just the mouse, then the mouse is pretty much useless in that scenario. And worse still, if you happen to carry it out of station with you and bring back only the mouse and forget to pack the dongle, then you're stuck and I don't think you get only the dongle (you'll have to check that with the seller), and  then the mouse is left useless in that case. 2. Now over to  the problem I am facing, which I did not see anyone else mention in their reviews. I use a MacBook, so it doesn't have USB-C inputs, which means you must buy a connector for it to connect the dongle. I actually had already bought a connector so that was not a problem for me, but you will have to factor in the cost of the connector, which is not cheap, because you want to buy only good quality connector for your expensive MacBook. Of course that is a problem with the MacBook and not with the mouse, but consider this point. It is very important. It will NOT connect over MacBook's Bluetooth. Otherwise, it works well with the MacBook. The only caveat I found is the tracking speed on level 2 is too slow and on level 3 is too fast. You'll have to get used to that thing. It doesn't feel very natural (as the trackpad on the MacBook feels) because of that speed problem, but otherwise, the pointer flows smoothly on screen and doesn't jump around, at least with my mouse. Also, the battery door does make a noise when landing the mouse on the pad, and I feel it could have been made better. But I guess at the cost, you really can't complain too much.Overall, I think a good buy, but the compulsion of having to use it with it's own dongle is a major drawback I feel. If that doesn't bother you, then nothing else should keep you from buying this product, especially since it is one of the cheapest wireless mice out there at less than 600 bucks, which is what it cost me."

91,Jyo30 ,3 March 2023,5.0 ,Amazing,good product on which you can use for long time
92,Jyo30 ,28 December 2022,4.0 ,Value for money,"I ordered the product replacement because I could not find the USB receiver module, failing to see that the black receiver is inside the black b170 Logitech mouse inside the darkest shadows where it is hardly visible, right next to the battery facing vertically upwards with its backside (black) facing you. I apologize to customer service for using harsh language on hearing that the product cannot be replaced. I asked my sister what can be done legally. She opened the mouse and figured out the located USB nano receiver. And yes, I am now using this mouse, after 7 days of worries about the replacement of this ""hidden"" product. The mouse is working fine."
93,Shivani singh,23 December 2022,5.0 ,"The USB receiver is inside the Mouse, near the battery plugged inside.",Product is as per it's description
94,mohsin,8 January 2023,4.0 ,Product is as per it's description,"Quality good, dpi good, good accuracy on off switch available, smooth, good deal at reasonable price."
95,Rajesh Madhukar Soman,4 November 2022,4.0 ,It's average wireless mouse,"It's light weight mouse. At on position it is not showing any light or signal. But I have not returned since it is working till the date. That's why I think it will not last for longer period.For long hours of  use and bigger size, sturdyness, and proper grip always go for DELL or HP wireless mouse Pricing above 600/-"
96,vinay k,14 December 2022,5.0 ,"Durable, durable, durable","Have been using for some 2 years now.  Use it at least 4 hours /day.  Refuses to die. What more, the battery is still the original one.  The buttons worked erractically  after approx 8 months. However here is the top secret to its longevity.....1.  The bottom is NOT screwed as with other mouse, where one has to search for the screws hidden below the mouse pads. The whole assembly is push fit. So , super easy to open and clean.2.  The magic cleaner is WD40.  One burst of WD40 on the switches and wheel, left for some 5 mins, reassembled it, and is good as new.Hope this helps."
97,Gansey,1 March 2023,3.0 ,Ok,Ok
98,Amazon Customer,25 February 2023,3.0 ,Decent at this price,Okayish
99,Amazon Customer,30 July 2022,4.0 ,An affordable and efficient mouse with one consistent flaw,"I've bought this mouse three times so far. Once in 2018, then in May 2021 and the third, yesterday. The funny thing about it is that both the old ones still work - except for the scroll-wheel that is grossly malfunctioning. I noticed a few others have also mentioned this issue and the pattern I noticed with the scroll wheel is more of a trend with this model of Mouse.The funniest thing is that I've been using this mouse for over a year now, with my office-laptop and the battery hasn't run out yet, but the scroll-wheel has succumbed to the twiddling of my index finger gliding over a few hundred spreadsheets. Wish such issues repeatedly reported by other reviewers, I honestly wonder why logitech can't seem to be able to fix it. Except, perhaps, they intend to leave it unfixed - how else would they have people like me buy their mouse every 12 months?The reason I chose to buy this a third time, is simply due to the low-cost and the value I receive in battery life and general accuracy that is sufficient for my office use. If there was another mouse that would give me the same kind of battery life as this model does, at this price-point, I'd be happy to switch."
100,Shiva,1 March 2023,5.0 ,Nice product,
101,A Sinha,1 January 2023,5.0 ,One of the Best Mouse for the price,The media could not be loaded.

103,Shashi,20 February 2023,5.0 ,Good,"Very smooth, works on almost every surface, paper, table, cloth etc.There's a bit rattle sound of the plastic which is just above the buttons (right/left clicks)It will not bother most of you, I am a bit Obsessive with these kind of things, So...[Personally I opened the mouse and stuck a paper inside the plastic which presses the click button, resulting in no rattle sound. Now mouse only makes sound when you click the buttons, (click click click)]Battery life of Logitech is known to be very good."

116,Sanket Naik,3 November 2022,4.0 ,Ergonomical mouse and value for money,"The only drawback of this mouse is that it does not work with Logitech unifying software. I use a wireless Logitech keyboard for my workstation and this mouse does not support the existing dongle. So have to use this with the provided dongle, with the limited usb slots, this becomes a problem."

128,Rohit,Reviewed in India 🇮🇳 on 25 October 2022,4.0 ,Best wireless mouse under this segment,"Before that i had a wireless mouse of zebronics which used to consume battery cell on weekly basis, In this mouse one battery cell works for months without any lag or disturbance.it works super smooth and never fails to execute the given commands."

I bought this product in month of February 2022 and now it’s July 2022. From past two days I was facing issue with the scroll click button the mouse. When I visited the service center I was told this particular model’s click button has issue and many customers have complained about it.So if you will be using the scroll button a lot compared to other buttons, someone like a CAD designer who will be using it. This mouse isn’t for you, but if someone who just uses left and right button and scroll to move up and down. This mouse is really worth and you can go for it."

190,Amazon Customer,8 January 2022,4.0 ,First impressions (24 hours later) - Big Thumbs up though marred by bad packaging,"I ordered this mouse for my primary desktop - the keyboard+ mouse combo (also Logitech) I use on this machine was sent off to the Raspberry Pi4.  I have a couple of wired mice - but I thought it was time to get a new one, since a mouse is one of the most used accessories.I had mixed feelings about Logitech- the mouse from a previous keyboard + mouse combo had died within 1 year, and replacement experience was let us say sub-optimal.But this mouse did the trick ! Small, lightweight, fast. Absolutely plug and play on my Linux Manjaro machine. Was impressed that the provided the AA battery for it- and it was protected from discharging using a label. One less thing to worry about :finding a AA battery.The adapter is inside the mouse itself. I knew this from experience, but for a newcomer it could be a little confusing at first.I inserted the adapter in the USB hub for my desktop, and voila! We were in business.First impressions after nearly 24 hours of installation- this mouse gets a thumbs up. Make the packing more robust and I am sure there will be more 5 star ratings."
191,mohit bohra,12 October 2022,4.0 ,Its a good mouse.,"It's perfect for portability, its small and comfortable to use. The click sound is a bit louder. I think its a good deal at 500rs or 600rs."
192,Aditya,27 September 2022,5.0 ,Compact and handy. Sleek design.,"Love it. Logitech has never disappointed me since so many years, be it the bulky 2.1 speakers long long ago, or their mice or keyboards.As with this mouse, it is quite sleek and compact. Not a bulky design. Easier to store in the sleeve-like laptop case. Functioning is pretty standard as the mouse should be and very responsive.Personally I like that it does not have the red light for optical reader.. that can get quite disruptive.The USB receiver is small and fits very well in the concealed USB port of my Lenovo laptop (doesn't protrude out), so that's good too.Go for it. Standard operation and expectation as is with optical wireless mice. Good purchase for me."

Very comfortable to use.,"I dropped my mouse dozens on times over 5 years, and nothing happened to it.It has a very ergonomic design, just the right size, but it may vary with different hand sizes. I experienced no lag at all, and the battery actually lasts a year(Depending on the quality of battery you buy, of course).Overall, there's nothing more I could ask from a wireless mouse, except extra gaming features like RGB or extra keys."

Really nice and elegant. No problems so far using it. The scrolling is smooth and there is no lag, connection is instant. It's plug and play along with the dongle provided with it, no pairing needed. There's a battery provided already with the mouse.The battery does add to it's weight but bothing to complain about that."
212,Meenakshi Mohata,13 March 2023,2.0 ,good to use but battery life is not 1 year,"They give a guarantee of 1 year working but it only lasted for 6 months my scroll wheel is not working and my most of the use in the mouse is related to the scroll wheel, it will be helpful if I get a replacement for one."

219,Nishank,27 June 2018,4.0 ,"Good Mouse, needs improvement in packaging, overall a good buy","The product came bad packaged, it seems like the mouse was imported in OEM form, and the box was made locally. The box itself was in shabby condition, bandaged from all possible sides.The mouse was in a plastic bag inside the box, has a few scratches in the bottom pane.Pros:1. The wireless receiver is very small, tucked inside the mouse.2. The indicator light below the mouse is completely invisible. Hence the battery time will be more. It's claimed highly in the product details, but I have to wait and see what happens.3. The mouse is very small in size. Sometimes I think it's going to slide away. Perfect for travelling.4. Auto sensor to switch off. Starts working/wakes almost instantly once you move the mouse.5. No separate software / configuration required.6. Good amount of instructions to locate the wireless dongle embedded inside the mouse.7. Single battery operation, making it light weight. Battery comes with the mouse and a pullout tag.8. Price is competitive.9. Good build quality.Cons:1. A little small in size, sometimes it felt the mouse is going to slide away. But then again it might be because of using bugger mouse in past.2. Bad packaging. This is one point which I really disliked about the product. Hence removal of 1 star.I started writing this review with a rating of 2 stars because I was really annoyed to see the packing in which it arrived. But eventually after going over the pros and cons, I decided it's worth it to give at least 4 stars.A definitely buy product, competitively priced."

248,Placeholder,Reviewed in India 🇮🇳 on 11 May 2022,3.0 ,Good - But Doesn't last long,"I have been using this mice for at least 5 years. Each one works for 6 - 8 months, after that mostly the scroll doesn't work or the middle button click doesn't work.For the last mice M170 (which is same as B170) however, I have seen the scroll is way better than what I had in the previous versions.But I'm a Linux user, and I use middle button click to copy-paste stuff, or close a browser tab, open a link in new tab, etc. Logitech installs very inexpensive micro-switch in the middle button, each micro-switch costs Rs. 1 and they are bound to be damaged after some repetitive clicks. And that's what happens over time.Claiming warranty is a pain, so I don't prefer going to that route.The plus point of these mice is that the battery lasts an eternity. I use my computer at least 12 hours a day (in general it's like 14 hours). The battery outlasts the life of the mice itself (which is 6 - 8 months)! And after purchasing a new mice, you can still use the old battery! The build quality is really nice and rigid. The right and left switches also lasts an eternity. Only problem is with scroll and the middle button click!"

251,Jyotirmoykarak,2 March 2022,4.0 ,Aesthetically appealing,Easy to hold ergonomically good I would say as it comes from logitech brand so its common to have good design aesthetics added to it also i feel the clicks are clicky but no to scroll it actually is not that much fluid as expected i don't know how long the scroll wheel will be able to last so hopefully i will metion it in future time if anything happens to it every thing else is good like sensitivity and accuracy are good enough you also get an app to change those according to your needsAt last look and feel are good also its durable so i would recommend this as a budget level mouse that you can go for

262,Sirjan Tudu,27 August 2022,5.0 ,Obvious purchase,"If you are looking for a perfect mouse then you can obviously go for it. The only problem you may have with this is its size that's all. I personally have no issues with that but rest is your choice. Built quality is quite good in this range, scrolling experience is smooth, clicking experience is smooth and after using more than 1 month I faced no connectivity problems.And also it has optical tracking system without laser so you will never have a sudden encounter of laser and your eyes. So I will recommend you if want a good wireless mouse."

288,Pooja S,Reviewed in India 🇮🇳 on 12 November 2022,5.0 ,"Super useful, using for past many months","As it runs on battery, I treat it with care. I just want to be responsible for my part, I am sure the mouse is long-lasting. I just have a history of rough use lol. So every day after my work I switch off the mouse and put the USB thingy back into the mouse. sometimes I switch off the mouse even if I take a break. Sometimes I forget but I would really like to continue this good habit of switching it off after unuse. Sometimes I put it back into its plastic bag hahha. I love how it automatically connects to my laptop.  I think it should be beneficial to buy a mouse pad... As you can see in the picture, I use random books available at my house. I would recommend buying a mouse pad for the buyer as well. I hate touchpads on laptops. I don't understand the big deal about it anyway. On top of that, my touchpad of my laptop has been destroyed. (inappropriate use from my side I guess) . Using a wired mouse gets annoying after a point. I always have to make the sure the wire is out of the way. Even when shifting my laptop from one location to another in my house, It makes me super irritable. Imagine the irritation if I take this outside. When I purchased this mouse, I just realized it I need it in my life... hahahahha. My wired mouse had the same structure and was a  logitech mouse. it the same sorta mouse just without the wire. before purchasing I already knew how it would feel in my hands. I am happy I purchased it . I think you should go for it too!!!!!"
289,Santhosh BS,Reviewed in India 🇮🇳 on 31 August 2022,4.0 ,Good to use mouse,Works fine no problem. For MacBook users: if planning to connect via adaptor (which also has other cables plugged in at same time: see photo) then range drops drastically. Shouldn’t matter if u r working on a desk. But when i connected MacBook to TV via dongle (having hdmi + this mouse usb receiver to it’s 2 ports) then i couldn’t use mouse from my couch

409,ABHISHEK NEGI,22 April 2022,4.0 ,Great design but range should be more,"The range is hardly 4 meters and after that it begins skipping control over clicks and hover...the design is the best I have ever seen, look feel click feedback everything else is superb. Definitely a worth it buy for close range users (<4meters)"

This cannot fit properly on my palm and will take some time to get used to it.The scroll button isn't smooth as well.You can go for this, however, if you are getting a better deal at this price, this one can be ignored."

437,Partha biswas,Reviewed in India 🇮🇳 on 30 March 2022,3.0 ,Duplicate or Discontinued Product,"Build: GoodBattery Backup: GoodWorking: Good  Scrolling: Bad  Left Click: Good  Right Click: GoodShould I go for it: At your own risk (Why? Read below)This product scroll button stopped working within the warranty period.But to my surprise, this product is not available on Logitech's official site for warranty claims. Either Amazon India is selling a discontinued product or it is a duplicate one. When you search for this model it is visible on most of the Ecom sites except Logitech.If you are lucky you may not face this issue as many others are facing. Except these other features are working fine for me for the last 10 months. After using 7-8 months scrolling feature gave up."
438,Rakesh P,Reviewed in India 🇮🇳 on 2 April 2022,5.0 ,Not the mouse you should buy,"I bought two of these. One last for 4 months only. All the while the tracking would go haywire. Itwas the most frustrating experience, but these problems starts after one month of use. Finally I dumped the first one.I started using the 2nd one fresh out of the packing. This one had all the tracking problems right from day one. I could not use it for more than a few hours, I have now put it back in the box and might use it only in emergency situations.Low quality product. Recommend to NOT buy."
439,Sasha,26 January 2023,2.0 ,It squeaks and a little smaller than my last mouse,Disliked that the mouse track squeaks making using it a noisy experience especially in office. Its also small for bigger hands.
440,Raju,2 November 2022,5.0 ,Impressed...,This is definitely the best one...
441,Bibhav ranjan das,16 July 2022,3.0 ,Just bought it,I am just giving it three stars for now because I just bought it. Reading the reviews it seems like scroll button is a joke. I will edit it in three months. If it works properly I will increase the rating to 5 stars. If the scroll wheel malfunction I will reduce the rating to zero stars.
442,Ryan Oliver,8 July 2022,4.0 ,Great Product and checks all the boxes.,Easy to use - just plug and play. Very smooth to operate.
443,Hemal Shah,29 September 2022,3.0 ,average product,Its economy model. Good who is using less but those who are using 4 to 5 hours for that this is not good quality.

462,Sanket Bhandari,3 November 2022,5.0 ,Ergonomically perfect,"The previous wireless external mouse I had purchased had so many battery & sensitivity issues that I found it very annoying towards the end, before having to finally discard it. It was another brand. Had used it for nearly 5 years, so can't complain much.Was a bit apprehensive while purchasing this one.Turned out to be fine so far. Haven't used it for gaming purposes yet. It's convenient & even the delivery was fast. This was 1 Amazon product that will forever hold a fond memory in my heart because the delivery executive actually allowed me to open the package & test it before paying.Had never been able to do that with any package before. Have never been able to do that with any package since."

466,Sabbah Haji,20 October 2022,5.0 ,The Best Mouse for Work,"After using the Logitech b170 wireless mouse, everything is fine except scroll wheel. When i scroll up or down it stucks and behave abnormally. Like if i scroll down, it scrolls both up and down and doesn't move further. The same issue I informed to customer support before warranty so they asked me to courier to their manufacturing place. instead i thought of purchasing some other wireless mouse."
467,Kiruba,25 June 2022,3.0 ,Review after using for a year,"I was using Logitech M235 for almost 2 years now, but all of a sudden pores/swells/lumps filled with oily liquid started to appear on its rubber part of the body where fingers were getting in contact with it. So being fear full of it being something like carcinogenic, I had to just change the mouse.After doing some searched I narrowed down on this one, since it doesn't seem to have rubbery body and is of plastic, so it probably won't suffer the same fate.Now to the product itself, I'll compare it with M235 quite often as I have used it for 2 years and it is in same price.1. It is larger than M235, just little but I actually appreciate it as it is much better to handle in slightly thicker hands.2. It is very smooth operating, I've used it on wooden rest as well as floor and it works quite well, almost better than M235 as I was using it for 2 years3. On off button is very convenient to use as its design is better than M2354. It is aesthetically way more appealing tan M2355. Plug and play, I used it on both Linux and Windows and it doesn't require anything other than simply putting the USB thing in USB slot, mouse starts working ASAPCons1. It is retaining some oily fingers, should be easy to clean but  still I found it more likely to get dirtier than M235 due to black body2. No light to indicate battery status, could be both +ve and -ve, but I would rather have it than not3. Packaging was very bad, that box came in almost crushed, but my product was okay so I didn't complain but it wont happen all the timeOverall it is wonderful mouse for Rs 499/-Would recommend, I can't yet comment on battery life as it is still early, but hopefully it will last for some time.Regards"
468,Milee Murmu,1 October 2021,4.0 ,Best economic and very good product,"Sexy design , slim , textured , side cuts are very good. Weight is exactly what is to be....not too heavy nor to light. Very appropriate size for any user. Bought this for general purpose and illustrator... Used this mouse almost more than 6-7 months.Note: There is no led light blinking ....( I thought ""Ohhh...f.... I got damaged product"" ) 😅 but the infrared light don't illuminate on this mouse and therefore it saves battery for longer run."

476,AmazonUser,12 April 2021,4.0 ,Average Performance,"I have been using this mouse for more than 8 months now. For the price point, I believe the performance could have been better.- Very low quality ""plasticy"" feeling- Clicks very tacky- If you are a heavy user, then you would need occasional cleaning of the mouse as the scroll becomes very jumpy due to grime settling on the scroll wheel axle.I have used their G series also and based on the performance those mice offer, I feel they should offer more on such entry level basic mice. Basically give something better than what other regular mice offer.There is nothing that stands out in this mouse for me to actually recommend it. But yeah.. it gets the work done."
